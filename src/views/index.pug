            p It describes a library made up of an “indefinite, perhaps infinite” number hexagonal of rooms, each lined on four sides by a bookshelf of five shelves, each self containing thirty-two books. Each book is four hundred and ten pages of forty lines, each line of eighty characters.
            p The character set in these books is limited to the twenty-six lower-case letters of the English alphabet, the comma, the full-stop, and the space. In the story, Borges actually says twenty-two letters, ignoring some he deemed unnecessary. The full alphabet is used on this site.
            p In its pages, the library contains every possible combination of these characters. No two books are the same — meaning that the library is “total — perfect, complete, and whole”. Everything that ever has been, or ever will be written using these twenty-nine characters is contained somewhere within the library.
